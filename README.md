# 🩺 Smart Wearable Elderly Care & Health Monitoring System  

A compact IoT-based wearable that continuously monitors **heart rate**, **SpO₂**, and **motion (fall detection)**.  
Built using the **ESP32-WROOM-32 N8R8**, integrating sensors, cloud support, and intelligent alerts for elderly safety.

---

## 📘 Overview
This wearable monitors vital signs and movement to detect abnormal heart activity, low oxygen levels, or sudden motion (falls).  
Data is sent wirelessly for cloud logging and remote caregiver alerts.
